          This has just been the best 4 years of my life. I thouroughly enjoyed my time at college and learnt a lot not just about Computers but also life skills.

          I spent a lot of my free time participating in almost a dozen of Hackathons, winning some of them, learning from some of them and extending my network at all of them.
